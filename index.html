        Vector illustration is a technique used in graphic design to create images using mathematical equations and geometric shapes. Unlike raster images, which are made up of pixels and can lose quality when scaled, vector illustrations can be scaled to any size without losing sharpness and clarity.

        One of the most popular tools for creating vector illustrations is Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator provides a wide range of powerful tools and features that enable artists and designers to create precise and scalable artwork.

        With Illustrator, you can create shapes, lines, curves, and gradients. You can manipulate and edit these elements using anchor points and control handles, allowing for precise control over the design. Additionally, Illustrator supports layers, which help organize and manage complex illustrations.
